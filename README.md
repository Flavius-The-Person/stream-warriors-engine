## Development setup

I do not have a packaged test yet that includes a 
Java Development Kit or Java Runtime Environment built in.
This means that you will need to have one installed on your 
system in order to run the program.

Describe how to install all development dependencies and how to run an automated test-suite of some kind. Potentially do this for multiple platforms.
